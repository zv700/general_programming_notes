# General programming notes repo

This is a general storage repo for storing my text and code notes as I learn various programming languages in hopes of becoming some kind of professional programmer. 

These notes originally come from code-along courses and tutorials. *These notes are originally for my own usage and* ***may not all be edited for general readability.*** I mostly wanted a place to store the notes I've taken over time in note apps, here and there, that I took using my computers and phone. 

- They are mostly written in MarkDown .md format, though you should switch to the code view if things do not look correct/are missing pieces of info, as some elements containing certain symbols (like: > <, <head>) may not appear correctly. (*At least, I haven't figured out how to get them to display properly, yet.*)
  
- Depending on the nature of certain courses/tutorials, some notes may be split between Markdown file and accompanying code files (.html, .css, .py, etc.)
  
- Not all code/projects are in working order because tutorials they are based on may have gone outdated, different versions of programs may have different features, etc. Non-working projects are included for my own reference.

*This repo is a work in progress!*
  
If you are reading this, I do hope you might find something useful. 

**Thank you for reading. Please, enjoy your stay!**
