- Python features make it quick/easy to develop applications


## First application

Hello, world!

	print("Hello, world!")

- above writes the message: Hello, world!
- "print" = a Python function
- Python functions take arguments/input inside of parentheses ()
- .py is the file extention for Python files
- a string is text within quotation marks"" that can be used as an argument/input for a function, strings can be manipulated
- can assign variables

## Variables

- store a value within a variable
- python does not require you to specify what type of variable (int = integer, etc.), automatically detects/infer type

- variables in python can be assigned values of various types: 

a = 28 [integer/int/number]
b = 1.5 [float/decimal/"floating point number"]
c = "Hello!" [str/string/ can also be single quots 'Hello!']
d = True [bool/boolean/can be True or False]
e = None [NoneType]

- NoneType is specific to python
- NoneType can only be represented by None
- "None" represents the lack of a value [if a function does not return anything]

## Types of data structures

- list = sequence of mutable values
- tuple = sequence of immutable values
- set = collection of unique values
- dict - collection of key-value pairs

### Lists are mutable
- mutable means items in a list can be changable, 
- can add to a list, 
- can delete items from a list, 
- can modify values within a list
- may have same value appear multiple times

### Tuples are immutable
- cannot add values to a tuple
- need to create a new tuple to add values
- may have same value appear multiple times

### Set
- sets do not keep values in a particular order
- similar to sets in math
- all values need to be unique
- use if you know a certain things are only going to show up in code exactly once

### dict = dictionary

- key value pairing
- like physical dictionary book: look up a word get a matching definition that goes with that specific word
- data structure where you look things up by one keyword/value and get another value as a result
- key-value pairs
- you look up the KEY
- the KEY gives you the VALUE
- KEY = word
- VALUE = definition
- map info to a value, so you can access that data later by looking up the key
