def square(x):  # <== function takes one input 
    return x * x

#for i in range(10):
#    print(f"The square of {i} ii {square(i)}.")

# use "def" KEYWORD to define a function/mark the beginning of a function
# functionName(inputOne, inputTwo, inputThree)
# Python functions can take multiple inputs, seperate each input with a comma and space
# above: x input can be anything, is a placeholder for a variable that you define later
# def square(x, y, z): <== example: if you want a function that takes three inputs

# for i in range(10): ==> causes the function to loop 10 times, looping inputs from 0 to 9, starts counting from 0 so loop inputs do not include number: 10
# i = iteration number, defined variable
# for each time a loop iteration completes, print the fstring
# original function is defined with x, but x is not a real variable. x is like a placeholder inside of a formula "your variable here"
# the for loop defines variable i, i takes the place of x in the formula/base function

# can import functions from Python modules, so a pre-written function can be used in other programs
